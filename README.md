# Data table extensions with `@tanstack/table`

This monorepo contains various examples of how to build complex data tables with
the `@tanstack/table` library. There will be support for both React and web
components for each example included here.

### Why?

The work and approach here is an iteration of the `Datagrid` component from
`@carbon/ibm-products`. Some of the challenges faced with building and
maintaining this component is that it is _not_ composable and thus creates a
barrier for the flexibility of experiences that can be created with it.

The example based approach outlined within this repo provides teams with a
launch point for creating complex data table interactions within the Carbon
Design System. The key difference is that this functionality is not wrapped
around one component (as is the case with the `Datagrid` from
`@carbon/ibm-products`).
